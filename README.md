# my_hangman_game
The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes representing each letter of the word.
The player guessing the word may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word. If the word is correct, the game is over and the guesser wins. Otherwise, the program will penalize the guesser by adding an element to the diagram. As the name of the game suggests, the diagram is designed to look like a hanging man. Once the diagram is complete, then the user lose!

ps: ASCII Art was used for the diagram
Enjoy!
